# NoSQL-Social-Network-API

# MVC Tech-Blog Hw 

## Description 
The motivation behind the project was to create a CMS-style website application where users can post blogs with content about different information that they'd like to view which was created using both the front end and the back end. We built this project because it allows users to easily navigate a website where they can share, and view other users' blog posts as well as create, view and delete their own blog posts so everything is consolidated efficiently. It solves the problem of functionality and being able to incorporate a backend with routes and models so that users can input specific data they'd like to see. I learned a lot about using handlebars, and getting that to work together with my sequelize models as well as the CRUD routes to allow everything to work together.
